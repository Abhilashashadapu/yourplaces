# üöÇ Railway Deployment Guide - Backend Only

## Current Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

The build error you encountered was because Railway was trying to build both frontend and backend together. For optimal deployment, we should:

**Backend ‚Üí Railway (this guide)**
**Frontend ‚Üí Vercel (separate deployment)**

## üîß Step-by-Step Railway Backend Deployment

### 1. Railway Project Setup
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your `yourplaces` repository

### 2. Configure Railway for Backend Only
Railway will automatically detect the `railway.toml` file which is now configured for backend-only deployment.

### 3. Set Environment Variables
In your Railway dashboard, go to Variables tab and add:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://ashadapuabhilash:placeguide@placeguide.rpkcnfk.mongodb.net/
JWT_KEY=f8faf6abb1c2577e5cbd0965fa035787446c8318e573fc085cbf7f7a03597a72ff62688f35a58a1a81a7f9b4ae0109946f8eb21a54a1422bb53c495f91729269
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBmuWNQs8-6Hce-TScTY4KbKfYPbmfFQMg
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 4. Deploy Backend
1. Railway will automatically deploy when you push to GitHub
2. Your backend will be available at: `https://yourapp-production.up.railway.app`

### 5. Deploy Frontend to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Set the Root Directory to `frontend`
4. Add environment variable:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://yourapp-production.up.railway.app/api
   ```
5. Deploy

## üéØ Expected Results

**Backend (Railway):**
- API available at: `https://yourapp-production.up.railway.app/api`
- Test endpoint: `https://yourapp-production.up.railway.app/api/users`

**Frontend (Vercel):**
- React app available at: `https://yourapp.vercel.app`
- Connected to Railway backend

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Railway build still fails:
1. Check that `railway.toml` is in the root directory
2. Ensure environment variables are set
3. Check Railway logs for specific errors

### If frontend can't connect to backend:
1. Verify `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` in Vercel settings
2. Check CORS settings in backend
3. Ensure Railway backend is running

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix for Current Railway Deployment

Since you're already in the middle of a Railway deployment:

1. **Cancel current deployment** if it's still running
2. **Commit and push** the updated `railway.toml` and `package.json`
3. **Redeploy** - Railway should now only build the backend
4. **Set environment variables** in Railway dashboard
5. **Deploy frontend separately** to Vercel

Your backend should now deploy successfully to Railway! üöÄ
